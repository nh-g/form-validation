# Build and validate a form manually, without the help of any external libraries

In this project, I practice to understand how forms are built in React and learn to avoid common pitfalls.

## Available Scripts

1. Clone repository `git clone https://github.com/nh-g/form-validation.git`
2. Open the terminal and navigate to the folder where the project is located.
3. Install dependencies: `npm i`
4. Run npm scripts: `npm start`
5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
